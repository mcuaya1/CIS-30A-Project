Projec title: Grocery Store App

Delivery APP was created to get groceries, essentials or more delivered to your door. 
With Delivery APP you can create a user account, place an order from a major supermarket and superstores 
like Walmart, Target, Costco, Best Buy, and Ralphs and shop for items from your phone. 
Once you are done shopping, it will display the items list, the cost of your order and you can set a delivery date.
